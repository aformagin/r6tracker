Open Source Rainbow Six Siege rank tracker

Using the R6Tab Unofficial API, the players user name, image and current MMR are displayed on screen. You will be able to add at least 5 players to the player list in order to compare your whole team. Currently it is set to use UPlay and NA ranks only, I may add an option later to specify region and platform.
